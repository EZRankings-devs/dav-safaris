## _The fully functional web application of dav safaris tour and travel company_

# Project Details

Dav Safaris website is a web application for a tour and travel comapany, travellers can book onsite from a range of tours packages.I designed the UI/UX using adobe XD and also turned the designs into pixel perfect designs.
The application is built in Reactjs,Redux, React Router v6, Material UI v4, among others

## Client's Requirements

The tasks are as follows:

1. Designing the Mockup using adobe XD
2. Responsive and beautiful UI and cross-browser page compatibility
3. API integration
4. Testing and Debugging
5. Documentation (Readme)

# Features

> Mobile Responsiveness:
> I had a task of making sure that the web pages are made responsive on different device widths

> Semantic tags:
> Use of the know semantic tags was also a checkpoint during the project, making sure that we used only tags that were neccessary.

> Beautiful UI and UX âœ¨:
> Bringing out the webpages as they appear in the mockup was the major goal of this task.

> Adding Logic and Making API Calls:
> The application enables users to book for tours of their choice, review any tour in real time.
> After the UI implementation, i had to add logic to the UIs making different calls and storing data in redux and passing it on to the different components where it had to be displayed. It was such an awesome experience getting to learn how to connect to metamask extension and capturing the account address to use it when making calls for different transactions.
